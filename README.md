# Personal-Website
Created personal website from scratch using HTML/CSS/Python

To run the website, you would need to have installed flask on your command prompt. The images and style.css will need to be stored in a folder titled "static" in the same directory as website.py. The HTML files will need to be stored in a folder titled "templates" in the same directory as the website.py.
